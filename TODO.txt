Things left to be done:

- Optimize function calls
	Quite a few lib_settings.get()'s and tprint.add()'s, along with others, occur in various files. These should be localized for speed.

- TMX files
	Support for the TMX map format.

- More code comments
	Self explanatory; some comments already exist, but Dusk is open-source and needs easy-to-read code so that anyone can pitch in.

- New culling algorithm
	Right now, only tile layers are cull-able. A refactoring of the culling system with a new algorithm could make all things be cull-able (and even open the way for rotated maps with culling, isometric maps, etc).

- Layer-specific scaling support
	Right now, the map can be scaled, but the camera system doesn't work so well with independent layers being scaled.

- TPrint "accounts"
	Multiple maps may make TPrint have issues with the traceback. If a way to create a single "account" for TPrint could be made, people could debug multiple maps with impunity.

- "Pro" version of Dusk
	TPrint could potentially slow down maps a bit; a version with no debugging calls could be a trifle faster. This could be implemented as a separate "build" step which doth create a new version of Dusk with no error messages (harder for development because of no meaningful error messages, but adding a slight speed boost).

- Make polygon objects using display.newPolygon
	Currently not done because of *unexpected* behaviour with Corona's polygon objects (looking into the problem, no worries).

- Demos
	Right now we only have one "full" demo (Bob). More demos to showcase different features are needed.
		- Physics without Box2D (via tile properties); perchance port one of the several LÖVE Lua physics engines to Corona
		- Platformer (with or without Box2D, preferably without, though we should probably have two versions)

- Instant update for scaling
	Without an onUpdate() transition parameter, transition.to() with scaling makes the map jitter when tile culling is turned on. A temporary solution could be a metatable with __newindex for scaling, or perchance a temporary transition library with onUpdate() included

- Arithmetic evaluation
	It would be simply thrilling if, within properties, you could prefix a value and have Dusk evaluate arithmetic automatically. Then a preset "variable table" could be created (with generic values such as screen width, height, map width, etcetera) that could be used in the evaluation. Like so:
	As layer properties, to make the layer fill the screen perfectly:
		xScale    = !eval! screen_width / layer_width
		yScale    = !eval! screen_height / layer_height

- TSX tileset files
	Tiled enables you to export tileset files as .tsx; Dusk could load these if TMX parsing is ever implemented
